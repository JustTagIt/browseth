title: Welcome to Browseth!

### A library for interacting with ethereum, well suited for the browser.

These docs are just getting started - first push on 4/23/2018.

We also blog about our development on Medium:
https://medium.com/buyethdomains/introducing-browseth-a-new-library-for-interacting-with-ethereum-795d18e7b87d

### Easy download with npm

Documentation may end up migrating over to NPM, and this site may be used mainly
as an overview of the "Big Picture" for why you'd want to use Browseth in your
ethereum app.
