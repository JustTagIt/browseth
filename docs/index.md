title: Welcome to Browseth!
---

These docs are just getting started - first push on 4/23/2018.

We also blog about our development on Medium:
https://medium.com/buyethdomains/introducing-browseth-a-new-library-for-interacting-with-ethereum-795d18e7b87d

### Easy download with npm

Documentation may end up migrating over to NPM, and this site may be used mainly as an overview of the "Big Picture" for why you'd want to use Browseth in your ethereum app.

### Getting Started

Coming Soon

### Browseth vs. Web3 and Ethersjs
