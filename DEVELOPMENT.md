# Contributing to Browseth

## Community

The [Browseth gitter](https://gitter.im/browseth-/Lobby) is the primary communication forum for the Browseth community. It is a good place to start whether you have a question, are a new contributor, a user, or anything else. The Browseth community is also governed by a [code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).

## Ways to contribute
 A small sample of the type of work that needs doing:
- Bug squashing and feature development.
- Improving our [user](https://browseth.readthedocs.io/en/public/index.html) documentation
- Reviewing code and [pull requests](https://github.com/buyethdomains/browseth/pulls).
- Making pull requests

**Non-code contributions**:
Some of the most valuable ways to contribute don't require any code at all.

Examples include:
- [Reporting issues](#reporting-issues) of feature requests and bug reports.
- [Giving feedback](#feedback) if you are evaluating or using Browseth.

## Reporting issues
If you find an easily reproducible bug and/or are experienced in reporting bugs, feel free to just open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/buyethdomains/browseth/issues).

If you have a feature request or are not yet sure what the underlying bug is, the best place to post issues is in [#issues](https://gitter.im/browseth-/issues) on gitter. This allows us to interactively figure out what is going on, let you know if a similar issue has already been opened, and collect any other information we need. Post a short statement describing the issue and how to reproduce it if known.

## Feedback
If you are part of a group that is either using or considering using Browseth, we would love to hear about your experience with the library.

Here are some questions weâ€™re always very curious to know the answer to:

- Evaluation: What is the process by which your project chose or will choose an Ethereum library?
- Pros and cons: What are the pros and cons of Browseth for your project, and the pros and cons of other libraries you are considering?
- Features: What are the features that are most important for your project?
- Onboarding: If you remember it, what was your impression during your first few minutes of using Browseth? What did you notice, and how did you feel? Was there anything that stood out to you as confusing, or broken, or great?
